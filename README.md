# 🏠 HA Dashboard – Minimalist Tablet UI

Welcome! 👋 This repository will eventually be updated with components of my **Home Assistant dashboard**, designed for a clean and minimalist experience — optimized especially for **tablet displays** like the Surface Pro.

A few people have expressed interest, so I’m happy to share what I’ve built so far. I hope it helps with your own setup or sparks some inspiration!
